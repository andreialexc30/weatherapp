<h2>About the app</h2>
<p>This is a web based weather application that uses data from mapbox.com and darksky.net, it allows up to 1.000 daily searches with the current API. You can use it to look up the daily weather in your area or anywhere around the world really. I made this app while following a course for back-end development with NodeJS. </p>
